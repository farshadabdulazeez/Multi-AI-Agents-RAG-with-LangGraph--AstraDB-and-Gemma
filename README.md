# Multi-AI-Agents-RAG-with-LangGraph--AstraDB-and-Gemma
This project implements a multi-agent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using LangGraph for orchestrating AI agents, AstraDB as a scalable vector store, and Gemma for enhanced language processing. The system intelligently routes queries between Wikipedia search and a vector database to provide accurate and context-aware responses.
